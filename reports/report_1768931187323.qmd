This choropleth map displays adult obesity rates across the continental United States in 2023, with states colored on a gradient from green (lower rates) through yellow to red (higher rates). The map reveals a clear geographic pattern, with Southern and Midwestern states showing the highest obesity prevalence (above 35%), while Western states like Colorado and coastal states tend to have lower rates, highlighting significant regional health disparities.

This radar chart compares five key health indicators between Colorado and West Virginia in 2023, with the polygon area representing overall health burden. West Virginia (red) shows substantially worse outcomes across all metrics—obesity, overweight prevalence, physical inactivity, and low fruit and vegetable consumption—while Colorado (green) demonstrates consistently better health behaviors, illustrating why these two states represent opposite ends of the national health spectrum.
